Aims

3. **Decentralized indices for genomic data.**
   The MinHash Bloom Tree can be viewed as a persistent data structure [@driscoll_making_1989],
   since leaves never change once added and internal nodes only change if a new leaf is added to its subtree.
   This makes it a very good fit for content-addressable storage
   methods, and I'm exploring two different decentralized data storage systems
   (IPFS and dat) as ways of storing and interacting with MinHash Bloom Tree indices.

   On top the data storage aspects,
   another important point is how researchers can interact with these indices
   (both querying and updating it) in a way that centralized storage is not essential
   (but operations are optimized if it is [@tsitsiklis_power_2011]).

   This is important in the context of long term sustainability of projects,
   something often overlooked in bioinformatics systems.
   The initial implementation is centralized for simplicity and prototyping the user interaction,
   supporting data submission and querying,
   with a data pipeline based on the experience downloading 800k+ microbial datasets from NCBI SRA
   and also the preparation of indices for the IMG database from JGI (60k+ datasets).

   Once this prototype is functional and we find what features are desirable,
   I plan to start decentralizing this process by defining updates in terms of CRDT operations,
   publishing a feed of these changes and moving to PubSub messaging between remote sites,
   allowing them to update their indices and keep them consistent with ours.
