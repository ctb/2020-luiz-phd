# Decentralized indices for public genomic data

\chaptermark {decentralized}

## Introduction

\todoin{
Extend discussion from centralized resources from previous chapter.

- Failure modes for public genomic resources: de-funding, too much data, most
  data infrequently accessed, bandwidth limitations

- Current solutions: move to cloud infrastructure, but charge from user for data
  transfer out of cloud infra (SRA and AWS/GCP)
}

## Methods

\todoin{
- The SBT index is amenable to content addressable approaches.
  Leaf nodes are effectively immutable (since original datasets don't change),
  and adding new leaf nodes to an existing tree doesn't change the other leaf
  nodes. Some internal nodes are changed, but most also stay the same.

- Allow operations to continue working if internal node data is not available
  (with a performance hit, but doesn't fail)

- Leaf-only SBT, basically the original MH collection with a tree structure,
  but without internal node data. Allow reconstructing the full SBT.
}

## Results

\todoin{
- Hosting SBT index and data on IPFS

- sourmash operations using a decentralized index
}

## Discussion

### Future work

\todoin{
 - Updating and syncing separate indices. Mergeable replicated data types

 - Integrating into wort. wort as minimal shim over decentralized infra.
}

## Conclusion
